An abstract class is a class that cannot be used to create a object. It has functions that are virtual and have no implementation within that class. A concrete class can be used ot create a object as it has implementation for all its functions.

Functions that shadow other functions in this workshop are:
Chequing and savings both have display functions based on iAccount
Chequing has credit and debit based on Account, which is based on iAccount
Chequing and savings both have monthEnd based on iAccount

I have learned about how to use base classes to take advantage of inheratance to simplify and organize code. As well as how to use a base class to be able to define what class to make a object from at runtime.
