The copy assignment operator checks for self assignment before doing anything as trying to deep copy memory starts with deleteing the existing memory in *this. Which would delete all the data in the resource, and crash the program by trying to copy deleted memory.

The copy constructor uses the copy assignment operator in order to reduce code. 

I have learned how to debug dynamic memory within classes, and to be very careful to ensure there are no buffer overflow errors that I am creating in my code.



There has been no new quiz scince the last workshop.
